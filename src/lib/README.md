# Library
This directory contains source code used by, but completely decoupled from, the Lemon compiler. This includes data structures and generic functions. 

The unit tests depend on the Unity software located in `/extern/unity` or found at (ThrowtheSwitch)[http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity].

In general, `/extern` contains decoupled 3rd party software while `/src/lib` contains decoupled in-house software.
