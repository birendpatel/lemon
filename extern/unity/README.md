# Unity
This repository contains a stripped down clone of the Unity testing framework from [ThrowTheSwitch](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity).

It has been copied over to the Lemon repository to reduce the number of dependencies that users of Lemon would have to manually install.

This is Unity version 2.5.4 (major-minor-build).
